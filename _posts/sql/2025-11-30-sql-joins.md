The **SQL JOIN** clause is fundamental for retrieving data from multiple tables in a relational database. 
It works by combining rows based on a related column between them. Understanding the different types of joins is essential for any database professional, enabling you to query and analyze complex datasets effectively.
A JOIN is a means to logically relate rows of one table to rows of another table. 
This is achieved by specifying a **join condition**, which is typically an equality comparison on one or more columns that exist in both tables (often the **primary key** of one table and the **foreign key** of the other).

# Types of SQL JOINs
There are four primary types of JOINs in SQL, each serving a distinct purpose in how they combine data and handle unmatched rows.

## 1. Inner Join
This is the most common type of join. It returns only the rows that have **matching values** in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
INNER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.key = TableB.key;
```

### Examples

**1. Orders and Customers**
> Retrieve orders that have a matching customer.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

**2. Students and Courses**  
> Retrieve students who are enrolled in courses.

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN courses c
    ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```
**3. Employees and Departments**  
> Retrieve employees that belong to a valid department.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**4. Products and Sales**  
> Retrieve products that have at least one sale.

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, s.sale_date, s.quantity
FROM products p
INNER JOIN sales s
    ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```

**5. Blog Posts and Authors**  
> Retrieve posts that have an associated author.

```sql
SELECT p.post_id, p.title, a.author_name
FROM posts p
INNER JOIN authors a
    ON p.author_id = a.author_id;
```

---

## 2. Left Join (or Left Outer Join)
Returns all rows from the **left table (TableA)**, and the matching rows from the right table (TableB).  
If there is no match in the right table, `NULL` is returned for the right table's columns.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
LEFT JOIN TableB
ON TableA.key = TableB.key;
```

### Examples 

**1. Customers and Orders**  
*Retrieve all customers, including those who have **never placed an order**.*

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**2. Students and Enrollments**  
*Retrieve all students, even if they are **not enrolled in any course**.*

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, e.course_id
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id;
```

**3. Employees and Departments**  
*Retrieve all employees, including those **not assigned to a department**.*

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**4. Products and Sales**  
*Retrieve all products, even products **with no sales yet**.*

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, s.sale_id, s.sale_date
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s
    ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```

**5. Blog Posts and Comments**  
*Retrieve all blog posts, including posts with **no comments**.*

```sql
SELECT p.post_id, p.title, c.comment_id, c.comment_text
FROM posts p
LEFT JOIN comments c
    ON p.post_id = c.post_id;
```
---

## 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the **right table (TableB)**, and the matching rows from the left table (TableA). If there is no match in the left table, `NULL` is returned for the left table's columns.

  * **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT columns
    FROM TableA
    RIGHT JOIN TableB
    ON TableA.key = TableB.key;
    ```
### Examples

**1. Orders and Customers**
> Retrieve all customers, including those who **have never placed an order** (customers are on the right).
```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
RIGHT JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

**2. Enrollments and Students**
> Retrieve all students, including those **not enrolled in any course**.

```sql
SELECT e.course_id, s.student_id, s.student_name
FROM enrollments e
RIGHT JOIN students s
    ON e.student_id = s.student_id;
```

**3. Employees and Departments**
> Retrieve all departments, including departments with **no employees**.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**4. Sales and Products**
> Retrieve all products, including products **with no sales yet**.

```sql
SELECT s.sale_id, s.sale_date, p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM sales s
RIGHT JOIN products p
    ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

**5. Comments and Posts**
> Retrieve all blog posts, including posts with **no comments**.

```sql
SELECT c.comment_id, p.post_id, p.title
FROM comments c
RIGHT JOIN posts p
    ON c.post_id = p.post_id;
```

### 4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
* Returns all rows when there is a match in **either** the left or the right table. 
* It effectively combines the results of a LEFT and a RIGHT join. Where there is no match, `NULL` values are used for the columns of the non-matching table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
FULL JOIN TableB
ON TableA.key = TableB.key;
```
  
## Usecase
Finding records that exist in **either** table, such as identifying all customers *or* all orders, and seeing where they overlap or where they are missing a match.

**1. Customers and Orders**
*Retrieve **all customers and all orders**, including customers with no orders and orders with no matching customer.*

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name,
       o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**2. Students and Enrollments**
*Retrieve **all students and all enrollments**, including students not enrolled in any course and enrollments without a valid student.*

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name,
       e.course_id
FROM students s
FULL OUTER JOIN enrollments e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id;
```

**3. Employees and Departments**
*Retrieve **all employees and all departments**, including employees without departments and departments without employees.*

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name,
       d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**4. Products and Sales**
*Retrieve **all products and all sales**, including products with no sales and sales referencing missing products.*

```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name,
       s.sale_id, s.sale_date
FROM products p
FULL OUTER JOIN sales s
    ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```

**5. Blog Posts and Authors**
*Retrieve **all blog posts and all authors**, including posts without authors and authors without posts.*

```sql
SELECT p.post_id, p.title,
       a.author_id, a.author_name
FROM posts p
FULL OUTER JOIN authors a
    ON p.author_id = a.author_id;
```

#### 🔑 Key takeaway (VERY INTERVIEW-FRIENDLY)

* **INNER JOIN** → only matching rows
* **LEFT JOIN** → keep all left
* **RIGHT JOIN** → keep all right
* **FULL OUTER JOIN** → keep **everything**

**Note:** Some databases (e.g., **MySQL**) don’t directly support `FULL OUTER JOIN`. It can be simulated using:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON ...
UNION
SELECT ...
FROM A
RIGHT JOIN B ON ...;
```

## Features and Differences with Other Joins

| JOIN Type | Result Set Focus | Missing Match Handling | Visual Representation (Venn) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INNER** | Only rows with **matches in both** tables. | Excluded | Intersection |
| **LEFT** | **All rows from Left** table + matched rows from Right. | `NULL` for Right table columns | Left circle + Intersection |
| **RIGHT** | **All rows from Right** table + matched rows from Left. | `NULL` for Left table columns | Right circle + Intersection |
| **FULL** | **All rows from both** tables (matched or not). | `NULL` for non-matching columns | Union (both circles combined) |

#### Non-Equi Joins and Self Joins

  * **Non-Equi Join:** A join where the condition is not based on equality (`=`), but uses other comparison operators like $>, <, \geq, \leq$, or $!=$.
      * *Example:* Joining an **Employees** table to a **Salary\_Grade** table to find the salary grade for each employee where the employee's salary is between the grade's $min\_salary$ and $max\_salary$.
  * **Self Join:** A join where a table is joined to **itself**. This requires aliasing the table to treat it as two separate logical entities.
      * *Example:* Finding pairs of employees who work in the same department or listing an employee next to their manager (assuming the manager's ID is stored as a foreign key in the employee table).

### Real-World Example: An E-commerce Database

Imagine an e-commerce database with two simple tables:

1.  **`Customers`**: `customer_id` (PK), `name`
2.  **`Orders`**: `order_id` (PK), `customer_id` (FK), `order_date`

#### 1. INNER JOIN Example (Matched Records Only)

**Goal:** Get a list of all orders that have a corresponding customer.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

#### 2. LEFT JOIN Example (Including Customers without Orders)

**Goal:** Get a list of ALL customers and any orders they have placed.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

  * **Result:** Customers who haven't placed an order will show their `name` but have `NULL` for `order_id`.

#### 3. Filtering for Unmatched Records (Inverse Joins)

A common use case is finding records that exist in one table but **not** the other. This is often done by using a **LEFT JOIN** and filtering for `NULL` values in the right table.

**Goal:** Find customers who have **never** placed an order.

```sql
SELECT c.name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL; -- Selects only the rows where the match failed
```
