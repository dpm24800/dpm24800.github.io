# **📘 Explanation of the Teaching**

This is a dialogue where Ajahn Ñāṇamoli Thero explains the **true meaning of anicca (impermanence)**, emphasizing that most people misunderstand it.

The key point:

> **Impermanence is not simply “everything changes.”**
> It is the impermanence of **sankhāras** — the underlying *determinations* that make experience possible and give rise to identification (“I,” “mine,” “myself”).

---

# **1. Not “Things are changing,” but “Your basis is unstable”**

Most people interpret anicca as:

* “Everything is changing”
* “Nothing lasts”
* “Science says the same thing”

But Ajahn says this superficial view misses the heart of the teaching.

### Why?
Because the Buddha did **not** say:
* “sabbe dhamma anicca — all things are impermanent.”

He said:

* **sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā — all formations (determinants) are impermanent**

This refers to the **conditioned structures** that make the sense of self possible.

You cannot see these sankhāras directly, because they are:

* the basis of your experience
* the background you take for granted
* always present *prior* to anything you notice

You only notice sights, sounds, feelings — **not the body and conditions that make noticing possible**.

---

# **2. The “Wrong Level” Problem**

Ajahn emphasizes:

> If you look for impermanence in the sights, sounds, or thoughts you observe,
> **you are at the wrong level.**

That is only **dhamma-level**.
Anicca applies at the **sankhāra-level** — the basis of experience that you *cannot turn toward directly*.

You have to discern it *peripherally*:
the enduring body, feeling tone, the givenness of existence.

---

# **3. The Body as the Primary Sankhāra**

Ajahn points out:

* You cannot see, hear, think, or experience anything without the **already-present living body**.
* This body is **not your creation**.
* It is **given**, **enduring**, and **beyond your control**.

When you feel “I see,” you forget:

* Your eye needs your living body.
* Your body is the prerequisite for the entire experience.
* Your ownership is assumed, not actual.

This forgotten fact is the doorway to understanding anicca.

---

# **4. “Buried Alive” — The Coffin Metaphor**

Ajahn uses a vivid image:

> Your life is like being in a coffin with air,
> but buried under kilometers of earth.

Why?

Because:

* You are completely enclosed within this body and these aggregates.
* You cannot go outside them.
* You didn’t choose them.
* Their nature is outside of your control.
* Yet you assume ownership and freedom.

The dread that arises when you stop distracting yourself is the recognition of:

* **being trapped within a changing, unreliable basis**
* **having no ultimate control**
* **being subject to disintegration at all times**

This is how **dukkha** follows from **anicca**.

---

# **5. Craving Is Reaction to Change**

Ajahn explains:

* You only crave because things have already changed in a way you don't like.
* You want change to stop, or to be different.
* Whether pleasant or unpleasant, craving always aims at **changing change**.
* You seek relief in the very thing (change) that creates suffering.

This is the *hook in the fish’s mouth* — the more you struggle, the deeper the hook goes.

---

# **6. The Way Out**

The Buddha says:

> Craving is abandoned through craving.

Meaning:

* You start by wanting freedom.
* But the method is **not to escape the body**,
  but to **stop resisting the nature of sankhāras** (their instability).

The path is:
* **Right View**
* **Mindfulness of death**
* **Understanding that all control is secondary to non-control**
* **Developing dispassion for craving**

The true “way out” is not leaving the coffin, but:

> **Not being bothered emotionally by the fact that you are inside it.**

When the aggregates break at death, that is the final release — nibbāna.

# **Summary in Simple Form**

**Anicca** =
The instability of the underlying basis (sankhāras) that makes your self and experience possible.

**Dukkha** =
Your emotional resistance to this instability.

**Anattā** =
Realizing none of this basis can be owned or controlled.

**Path** =
Developing dispassion toward craving by seeing the nature of sankhāras.
